## Overview

openArtBrowser <http://openartbrowser.org> invites you to browse through the world of arts, enjoy beautiful artworks and learn interesting things. We provide paintings, drawings and sculptures all over the world and from many periods.

This project contains:

- Scripts to crawl relevant data about artworks, artists, genres, locations, materials, motifs and movements from Wikidata

- Scripts to preprocess the crawled data

- Angular frontent

## Frontend

To start the frontend:

- download and install Node.js.
- open a terminal and install Angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

- for development mode: `ng serve` from artbrowser/app folder, app will be available in a browser on localhost:4200

- for deployment: `ng build --prod` on server and copy files to target directory

Frontend configuration:

- default elasticSearch url is 'http://openartbrowser.org/api/_search'

- to call a locally running elasticsearch docker container, run `npm run start_docker` or `ng build --configuration=e_local`

- To change elasticSearch url to another server, change the above url in ‚app/src/app/core/services/data.service.ts‘

## Local Elasticsearch

To build and run the elasticsearch docker container for local development, run the docker_elastic.sh script in the scripts
directory. The building might take some time because of the included wiki crawling. For the docker container
the wiki crawling is limited to a specific amount of objects per category. This amount is represented by the **DEV_LIMIT**
variable in the **ArtAntologyCrawler.py** script and thus can be adjusted there.
